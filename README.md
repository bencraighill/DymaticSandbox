# Dymatic Sandbox Project

<h4>Latest Build:</h4>
<i>Dymatic Engine version 25.1.0 (Development)</i>

## Description

This repository contains the main testing sandbox and example project for Dymatic Engine. It is kept separate from the main engine and instead included as a submodule. Note this should only be used as an example, not the basis for your own projects. When creating a new project, use the Dymatic Project Browser to create a blank template.

This project requires the corresponding version of [Dymatic Engine](https://github.com/bencraighill/Dymatic) and associated tools to be installed.
To find out more about the project and using the engine visit our [website](https://www.dymaticengine.com) or view any required [documentation](https://docs.dymaticengine.com/).
